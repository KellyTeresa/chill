                   \n\n Version 1.0.1: Now even BasicObjects can be chill!
                   \n Version 1.0.2: Unfortunately, certain people are not chill.
                   \n Version 1.0.3: With time, chill status can be regained.
                   \n Version 2.0.0: Now your puts statements are more chill with the addition of chill colors.
                   \n Version 2.0.1: Fixed a totally not chill bug"
